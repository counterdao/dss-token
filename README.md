## DSSToken â€” frob an inc, get a dss-token

`DSSToken` is an example ERC721 token that uses [dss](https://github.com/counterdao/dss). The contract
makes use of several `DSS` counters:

- `coins` tracks the current token ID.
- `price` is used to calculate the `mint` price.
- Each token has its own `count`, accessible to the token owner.

To `mint` your own `DSSToken`, call `mint` and send ether equal to the current `cost`.

The minimum `cost` of a `DSSToken` is 0.01 ether. However, anyone may call `hike` and `drop` to modify the
current `cost` by 10%. If you choose to `mint`, consider using
[Flashbots Protect](https://docs.flashbots.net/flashbots-protect/overview) to avoid unwanted reverts.

Additionally, `mint`, `hike`, and `drop` will distribute `CTR` governance token to
the caller if a sufficient balance remains in the `DSSToken` contract.

Proceeds from `dss-token` will offset the cost of `dss` deployment and compensate the CounterDAO Protocol
Engineering Core Unit.
